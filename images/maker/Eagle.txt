Eagle was a marque of the Chrysler Corporation following the purchase of American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987 and marketed through the end of the 1998 model year. It was aimed at the enthusiast driver and promoted as more "European" than the automaker's similar models.The "Eagle" name was taken by Chrysler from the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle models that were introduced for the 1980 model year.[2] This was the last of American Motors' wholly U.S.-designed vehicles and arguably the first modern mass-production crossover automobile. The Eagle name also appeared on a number of Jeep trim packages and special models that included the J-10 pickup trucks, the wide-track Cherokee SJ, as well as the CJ-5 and CJ-7 models starting in 1976.You can also choose the junk yards and salvage yards to buy the car parts that are not available online.
