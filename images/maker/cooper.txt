The Cooper Car Company is a car manufacturer founded in December 1947 by Charles Cooper and his son John Cooper. Together with John's boyhood friend, Eric Brandon, they began by building racing cars in Charles's small garage in Surbiton, Surrey, England, in 1946. The Mini Cooper was also awarded the title of the second most influential car in the 20th century. The car has also been marketed under the names of Austin and Morris. In 1994, after the BMW bought the Rover Group, the production of the car was still continued using the same name.
