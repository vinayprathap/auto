INFINITI is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Nissan. Infiniti officially started selling vehicles on November 8, 1989, in North America. The marketing network for Infiniti-branded vehicles includes dealers in over 50 countries. In 2012, Infiniti moved its global headquarters from the Nissan corporate building in Yokohama and incorporated in Hong Kong as Infiniti Global Limited, with Carlos Ghosn intending for Infiniti to have a greater focus on the burgeoning luxury market in mainland China as it forecast the country to become the largest luxury car market.  In 2013, Infiniti has showcased their new model car called “Q30” in Frankfurt Motor Show and after that Infiniti has made a expressive impact and had a good start in their sales. After producing the Q60 crossover known as JX35, Infiniti has started to launch their products outside Japan officially. At the present Infiniti is on producing television series too such as “Where are we going dad” which was a Chinese television series, along with their automobile manufacturing.
