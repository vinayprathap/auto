Lincoln, formally the Lincoln Motor Company, is a luxury vehicle brand of the American manufacturer Ford Motor Company. Marketed among the top luxury brands in the United States, Lincoln has competed closely against Cadillac for nearly its entire existence. Lincoln has the distinction of establishing the personal luxury car segment, with the entry of the Lincoln Continental into mass production in 1940.
Lincoln Motor Company was founded in 1917 by Henry M. Leland, naming it after Abraham Lincoln; in 1922, Lincoln was acquired by Ford.[5] Following World War II, Ford formed the Lincoln-Mercury Division, pairing Lincoln with its mid-range Mercury brand through 2010. In 2012, Ford rebranded the Lincoln division under its original name, Lincoln Motor Company.
 Lincoln remains the sole luxury nameplate of Ford Motor Company. The current product range of Lincoln consists of sedans, crossovers, and SUVs. Outside of retail markets, Lincoln has produced vehicles for limousine and livery use throughout its entire existence, with several examples used as official state limousines for Presidents of the United States.
