Marcos Engineering was a British sports car manufacturer. The name derives from the surnames of founders Jem Marsh and Frank Costin.Marcos was founded in Dolgellau, North Wales, in 1959 by Jem Marsh with aerodynamicist Frank Costin. Costin had earlier worked on the De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and from there he got the idea to use plywood for the chassis. The company moved to a converted mill in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire in 1963; in 1971 they relocated to a £125,000 purpose-built factory at nearby Westbury.
