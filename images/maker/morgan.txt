The Morgan Motor Company is a British motor car manufacturer that was founded in 1910 by Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan.

Morgan is based in Malvern Link, an area of Malvern, Worcestershire, and employs 177 people. Morgan has stated that they produce 850 cars per year, all assembled by hand. The waiting list for a car is approximately six months, and has sometimes been as long as ten years.

Morgan cars are unusual because wood has been used in their construction for a century, and is still used in the 21st century for framing the body shell. A visitor centre and museum have exhibits about the company's history from Edwardian times until the present day, developments in automobile technology, and a display of automobiles. There are also guided tours of the factory.
