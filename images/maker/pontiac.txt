 During the periods of 1980s Chrysler has launched their K-Car and had the successful sales record on that, so General Motors were in a position to launch a competitor for the Chrysler model and General Motors has launched Pontiac’s brand model called “Fiero” in 1984 and it was a successful model too. Unfortunately in 2009, General Motors has announced that they are going to stop the manufacturing under the Pontiac brand and they are going to focus on other subsidiaries such as Cadillac and Buick. The last vehicle was built in January 2010 under the Pontiac brand. However Pontiac was a very popular vehicle in all over the world particularly in Canada.
