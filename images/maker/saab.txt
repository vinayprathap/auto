Saab Automobile AB  was a manufacturer of automobiles that was founded in Sweden in 1945 when its parent company, SAAB AB, began a project to design a small automobile. The first production model, the Saab 92, was launched in 1949. In 1968 the parent company merged with Scania-Vabis, and ten years later the Saab 900 was launched, in time becoming Saab's best-selling model. In the mid-1980s the new Saab 9000 model also appeared. In 1989, the automobile division of Saab-Scania was restructured into an independent company, Saab Automobile AB. The American manufacturer General Motors (GM) took 50 percent ownership with an investment of US$600 million. Two well-known models to come out of this period were the Saab 9-3and the Saab 9-5. Then in 2000, GM exercised its option to acquire the remaining 50 percent for a further US$125 million; so turning Saab Automobile into a wholly owned GM subsidiary. In 2010 GM sold Saab Automobile AB to the Dutch automobile manufacturer Spyker Cars N.V.  After Saab started their “92” project then they has designed few models in cars but in all of their models we could see the resemblance of their aviation designs. In 1955 they have redesigned the “92” model and it renamed as “93”. The recreation has done by the major replacement which was about cylinders: it has been upgraded to 3 cylinders in the “93” model. After several years passed, Saab was in a need of a large model than their existing vehicles and in 1967 they have launched their model called “Saab 99” and it has fulfilled their need so.
