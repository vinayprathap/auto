Saleen Automotive, commonly known as Saleen /s?'li?n/, is an American manufacturer of specialty high-performance sports cars and high-performance automotive parts. Saleen is headquartered in Corona, California, USA. On June 26, 2013 Saleen Automotive, Inc became public through a reverse merger. It is listed on the OTC Bulletin Board and is controlled and majority owned by Saleen brand founder Steve Saleen.

Saleen's flagship car was the Saleen S7, introduced in 2000. The S7 was wholly built by Saleen and features a mid-engine design in a high-performance supercar package. It is also currently the only Saleen production car not based on an existing design or chassis.

Saleen currently manufactures the S302 (Mustang-based), a Ford F-150-based Saleen Sportruck and Saleen S1, a new Saleen supercar, a limited run successor to the S7 supercars.
