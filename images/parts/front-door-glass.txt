INFO - Car glass includes the rear and side windows, and a windscreen. Sometimes, there may be a glass roof. The side windows can be fixed, or a power or hand cranked window allowing it to be raised and lowered. A powered sunroof is a retractable and transparent window that can be fixed, powered or manually open.

There are models which provide sun blinds for the rear side and rear windows. Also, window shields are a feature which provides additional protection and safety from debris, while providing the driver more comfort. Most car glass uses a glass run channel to hold it in place, this also helps contain glass fragments if glass is broken..
